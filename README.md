**LEXA.AI PROJECT REPORT**

**1. Abstract**
 Lexa.AI is an innovative natural language processing (NLP) platform designed
 to provide comprehensive legal guidance based on Pakistani law. This project
 integrates various NLP techniques, advanced machine learning models, and
 linguistic analysis tools to deliver structured and insightful responses to user
 queries. Lexa.AI aims to bridge the accessibility gap in legal information by
 providing a user-friendly interface for legal research and guidance.
 
**2. Introduction**
 Lexa.AI addresses the challenges faced by individuals in understanding and
 accessing the intricacies of Pakistani legal frameworks. With features like legal
 query processing, linguistic analysis, sentiment analysis, and multilingual
 support (English and Roman Urdu), the platform delivers context-aware
 information. The project is implemented using Python, Streamlit, and
 state-of-the-art models like LLaMA-3.1-8b-instant and sentence-transformers.
 
**3. Features and Functionalities**
**i. Legal Query Processing**
 ● Users can input legal queries, which are processed to provide structured
 responses based on the Pakistani legal system.
 
**● Theresponse includes:**
**○ Overview: Summary of the legal context.**
**○ Section Description:** Details on relevant sections of the law.
 **○Legal Provisions:** Key clauses and legal details.
**○ Punishments:** Applicable penalties and consequences.
**○ Related Precedents:** Landmark cases and their outcomes.
 **○ Recommendations:** Practical advice for the user.
 
 **ii. Multilingual Support**
 ● Implements a machine translation model, Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ur, to
 translate text between English and Roman Urdu.
**iii. Sentiment Analysis**
 ● UsesTextBlob to analyze the polarity and subjectivity of user queries to
 infer emotional tone.
**iv. Linguistic Analysis****
 ● SpaCyis used for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and Named Entity
 Recognition (NER), providing detailed linguistic insights.
**v. Data Indexing and Retrieval****
 ● Leverages VectorStoreIndex and SimpleDirectoryReader for indexing
 legal documents.
 ● Processes legal texts, including key Pakistani legal documents, into
 searchable chunks for efficient retrieval.
**vi. User-Friendly Interface**
 ● Built with Streamlit, offering an interactive and intuitive user experience.
 ● Features tabs for legal response, linguistic analysis, and sentiment
 metrics.
 
**4. System Architecture**
 i. Input Handling
 ● Accepts user queries via a text input field.
 4
 ● Optionally translates queries into the desired language.
ii. Text Processing
 ● Queries are enriched with additional context for better LLM understanding.
 ● SpaCyprocesses queries for POS tagging and NER.
 iii. Query Engine
 ● UsesLLaMA-3.1-8b-instant for processing enriched queries.
 ● Retrieves relevant legal information based on indexed documents.
 iv. Output Generation
 ● Structured responses are generated and displayed in separate tabs:
 ○ Legal Response: Comprehensive analysis of the query.
 ○ Linguistic Analysis: POS tags and NER results.
 ○ Sentiment Analysis: Polarity and subjectivity metrics.
 v. Backend Storage
 ● Indexes legal documents into a persistent storage system using
 VectorStoreIndex.
 ● Enables fast and accurate document retrieval.
 5. Technology Stack
 ● Programming Language: Python
 ● WebFramework: Streamlit
 ● NLPLibraries: SpaCy, TextBlob
 ● Machine Translation: MarianMT (Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ur)
 ● Language Models: LLaMA-3.1-8b-instant,
 sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
 ● Document Indexing: VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
 ● Deployment Tools: Streamlit’s built-in hosting
 
**6. Implementation Methodology**
**i. Preprocessing and Indexing**
 ● Imported legal documents were preprocessed and split into manageable
 chunks using SentenceSplitter.
 ● Indexed documents using VectorStoreIndex for efficient search and
 retrieval.
 **ii. Integration of Language Models**
 ● Configured LLaMA-3.1-8b-instant for handling queries with enriched legal
 context.
 ● Integrated Helsinki-NLP’s MarianMT for translation tasks.
**iii. Sentiment and Linguistic Analysis**
 ● UsedTextBlob to analyze sentiment polarity and subjectivity.
 ● Employed SpaCy for extracting POS tags and named entities.
 **iv. Interactive User Interface**
 ● Designed an intuitive interface using Streamlit with tabs for legal
 response, linguistic analysis, and sentiment metrics.
 ● Enabled optional translation and user-friendly error handling.
 
**Conclusion**
 Lexa.AI successfully demonstrates the potential of NLP in democratizing legal
 information. By combining advanced machine learning techniques with a
 user-friendly interface, it provides context-aware legal guidance.
